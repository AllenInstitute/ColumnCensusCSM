# Code used for Schneider-Mizell et al. 2025

This code was used for the processing and analysis pipelines in Schneider-Mizell et al. 2025 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07780-8). Data is hosted on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/16905603).

It is not totally seamless to run with current tools, and most of the pipelines, particularly skeletonization, were subsumed into the CAVE suite and additional packages and should be accessed through different methods now. This code is provided for archival and descriptive purposes.

If you would like to use or adapt this code, please contact Casey Schneider-Mizell for more up to date resources.
